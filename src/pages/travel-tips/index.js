                    We think, Budapest has such a unique location; whichever direction you choose to go, you will find something interesting to see, live and experiment! You have mountains and many lakes around, the Adriatic Sea is in a comfortably reachable distance when on a road trip, but Ionian, Aegean and Black Sea are not impossible either.  Dream big, take a van and just follow your heart!
                    Just to give you an idea, we have marked a few interesting places to visit around us; trekking, mountain climbing, rafting, animal watching, wine-tasting, windsurf, sun bathing, horse-riding and many more! Interested?

                    When you are traveling with a campervan, you will carry some valuables that will stay inside when you park and leave the vehicle for any reason. Probably your stuff is more expensive than the price of few hours in a watched parking. Never leave your belongings in sight and make sure that the car is properly closed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always park the van carefully. Make sure that parking is allowed where you intend to park. If you are not sure, ask somebody or look for another place; better safe than sorry.

                    Probably the greatest advantage of a road trip is your freedom. Liberty to choose which way to go, what see, how long to stay there and where to head next. Still, as you have a given time, it is useful to plan your route a bit and know the best spots around, places where you can spend the night and distances. The mobile phone is an excellent tool on the go. Below you can find a bunch of <b>helpful Apps</b> that can be used even without Internet access.
                </p>

                <Heading content={"Night time"} type={"h3"} />
                <p>
                    It is with you to choose whether you would like to have more commodities and spend the night in a watched camping, or you would like to have more privacy and decide to spend the night in the wild. Both have their advantages, so we personally like to combine both. When you are in a camping, you can go to discover the surroundings by feet or bicycle with the peace of mind that the van and your belongings are safe. In a camping, you can have a nice shower, comfortably wash your clothes and hang them to dry at the camping pitch. You can also have some social life and meet other campers. While camping places provide you comfort, spending the night in the nature has something different to offer to you. It is more private and over all adventurous. It is something we definitely think everyone should try once in a lifetime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you chose to stay overnight in a camping or in the nature, please, follow the rules. Our basic rules are respect and common sense! Always respect the nature and others!

                    If you travel in Croatia, this is an IMPORTANT note for you!
                </span>
                <p>
                    <b>Law on the Host Activities in Croatia</b>, dated 01/05/2009, <b>Article 27</b> states that camping (including a simple overnight stay in the vehicle, or parking it outside each dedicated parking space) outside the camps in Croatia is an offense punishable by fine. In the case of such unauthorized camping on private land (land that is not owned by the state, municipal or city), the inspector may decide for an immediate sealing of the vehicle for a period of 60 days (<b>Article 43</b> of the same law). Unauthorized unsealing of the vehicle is an offense.

                    Alfresko experience couldn’t happen without the surrounding environment, nature and people. As travellers, we think it is extraordinary to be able to go and see hidden places, discover regions that are still not flooded by tourism, get to know the locals and be able to see and experience how they live. But as travellers, we must appreciate and respect this perfect balance we discover in the surrounding nature, and its people. Here, we collected a few tips for you to be more environmental friendly and help to keep the harmony between nature and humans.
